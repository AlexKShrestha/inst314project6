This dataset is composed of responses from 10 people from an anonymous survey for my statistics class about 3 different types of feminism: difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring. They have to read the definition of each of them and then approximate their degree of agreement with each approach. It's made up of 13 columns those being:

1) answer to Q1
2) answer to Q2
3) answer to Q3
4) answer to Q4
5) answer to Q5
6) respondent's age
7) respondent's gender
8) respondent's occupation
